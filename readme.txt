* NOTE: I would like to request your IP address to send to me to white list in mongodb network access for the connection of the DB.
* To run the server file  un the command node server.js.
* Access the server at http://localhost:7080 in the same machine.
* If it is other machine access the server within the same network and with the server machine ip like ex (http://192.168.1.71:7080).
* As I suggest you to login into 2 or 3 machines and use the application for better experience and you see more features.
